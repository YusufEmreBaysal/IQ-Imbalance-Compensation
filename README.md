# IQ-Imbalance-Compensation
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted an IQ Imbalance Compensation Project. Amplitude and phase imbalances between the in-phase and quadrature components of quadrature oscillators can significantly degrade the accuracy of signal modulations and demodulations [1]. In this report, we first demonstrate how IQ imbalance affects signals with various modulations. Next, we introduce a blind compensation algorithm designed to minimize these imbalances. Finally, we test this algorithm using signals that are affected by IQ imbalance and white noise. The results indicate that the blind compensation algorithm effectively mitigates both amplitude and phase disparities.
