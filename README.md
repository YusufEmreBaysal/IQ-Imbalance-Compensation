# IQ-Imbalance-Compensation
IQ imbalance is a phenomenon that can manifest in RF receivers, leading to bit errors in received signals. In this project, we examined a theoretical solution to address this issue using MATLAB. We simulated the captured waveforms and measured the bit error rates to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
